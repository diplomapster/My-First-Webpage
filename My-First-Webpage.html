    <h1>Hi, Welcome to this webpage</h1>
    <h2>Glad you are here</h2>
      <p>This super interactive and state of the art webpage was created during a
        single afternoon using html5 by a first time student at epicodus Seattle.
        They are making this webpage to practice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building Confidence</li>
          <li>Communication</li>
          <li>Attention to Detail</li>
        </ul>
    <h6>This is a mini header</h6>
    <p> It is the smallest one you can do</p>
    <p> I do not know why and am sure nobody does, it seems arbitrary</p>
    <h3>Header sizes that do not exist</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Seven</li>
        <li>Ten</li>
        <li>One hundred and sixty four</li>
      </ol>
